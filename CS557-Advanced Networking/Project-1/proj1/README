P2P File Sharing Network

INFO
----

P2P File sharing network software is a simulation of peer to peer
file sharing system. Network is simulated with the help of config 
file.(config.txt) File in the network is downloaded by clients 
with the help of tracker process. Download file and Downloaded file 
will be in a same folder.

Client to Client message format
-------------------------------

Client to Client message format contains following message types.

*Request Chunk List

-Message Type
-File Name
-Node ID

*ReplyMemoryMap

-Message Type
-File Name
-Node ID
-Available chunks

*AskData

-Message Type
-File Name
-Node ID
-Chunk requested

*Provide DATA

-Message Type
-File Name
-Node ID
-Chunk number 
-Data

I did one change in change in Client-Tracker message format
--Added one more field of File Size.
This helps to figure out actual file size and form memory map on clients
which don't have files.


Idiosyncrasies
--------------
There are following idiosyncrasies in the project.

-Wrong file name or blank fields may incounter unexpected termination
-File Name more than 31 charachers may through exception 
-Project fail to produce correct output format

This protocol may cause problem when there is a transfer with loss.
This can be eleminated by providing guaranteed packet delivery mechanism
like TCP.

Termination method
------------------

As protocol is managing state of the communication in each message transfer
and data transfer. Client may choose to terminate anytime. In this project client
terminate when it has nothing to do in network.(That is file sharing or file donwload)
