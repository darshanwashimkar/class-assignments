A File Sharing Network over NDN

INFO
----

A File Sharing Network over NDN is a simulation of peer to peer
file sharing system. Network is simulated with the help of config 
file.(manager.config). Download file and Downloaded file will be 
in a same folder. All the (.out) files will be saved in (out) folder.
Clients request to the network for intended file, if any node have 
already published the same file then client receives the response 
otherwise client will keep asking for given file unless time out 
occurs.


HOW TO COMPILE and RUN
----------------------

Compile - go to program directory

$ make all

Run - go to program directory

$ ./proj2


Before running program please make sure you have installed CCNx and put
manager.config file in the directory.


Implementation experience
-------------------------------

First of all, time I spent working on this project (proj2) is 1/3 of a 
time I worked on project one. I think it is because of following reasons.

* I already had lot of reusable code.
* After implimenting project 1, I got better and more efficient ideas of 
  how such project can be implimented and what can be the challeges?
* Overhead of creating overlay network which will track all interested clients,
  which was not there in project 2 (All this things are managed by CCNx)


Suprising Things
----------------

* Easier deployment
* With considerably less number of changes, we can shift same application to 
  NDN architecture (At least in such type of application )
* Data caching by NDN comes very useful with P2P applications like this project.
  Which can drastically decrease file downloading speed.
* NDN can work extraordinary in followng type of applications
  - Streaming Video, where multiple users are attempting to view the video
  - Simultaneously in real time broadcast applications 
  - File Sharing
  - Instant messaging, VoIp


Comparison with traditional networks
------------------------------------

There are many advantages of NDN over traditional network architecture specially

- In terms of content distribution, NDN saves lot of overhead of traditional network 
  architecture.
- In case of IPv4, we had crises for available name spaces. There is no such limitation
  in case of NDN.
- NDN provides flexibility about publisher of data. It is relatively simpler in NDN.
- Implimenting broadcasting is extraordinarily easier in NDN.
- Security if primery concern of today's internet architecture, this is well addressed in NDN.

Drawbacks of NDN
----------------

* For poorly designed application over NDN (ex. Without publisher key), anyone can poison
  publisher's content. For example, in case of this application if anyone(another user)
  publish same file url, then they can poison content in network and client will not receive
  correct information.
